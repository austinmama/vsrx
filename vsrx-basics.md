# Performing IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX Basics
The IBMÂ® Cloud Juniper vSRX gateway can be configured using a remote console session through SSH or by logging into the Juniper web management GUI.

**NOTE:** Configuring the vSRX outside of its shell and interface may produce unexpected results and is not recommended.

## Accessing the Device Using SSH

You can access the vSRX using SSH through a public IP address, or through a private IP address if you're on SoftLayer VPN:

1. Go to Gateway Appliance Details screen and get the Public gateway IP or Private Gateway IP.

2. Click the "eye" icon to reveal the admin user's password. 

3. Run the command `ssh admin@<gateway-ip>`, then enter the admin user's password.

**NOTE:** If you do not see the "eye" icon, you may not have permission to view the password. Please check your access permissions with the account owner.

## Accessing the Configuration Mode

You can enter the configuration mode, once a shell has been opened to the vSRX, by running the `config` command. You can do several things in this mode using the following commands:

* `show` - View configurations  
* `show | compare` - View staged changes
* `set` - Stage changes
* `commit check` - Verify the syntax of the configuration

If you are happy with your changes, you can commit them to the active configuration by running the commands `commit` and then `save`.  

To leave Configuration mode run the command `exit`.

## Accessing the Device using the Juniper Web Management UI

The Juniper web management GUI has been configured by default, with vSRX generated self-signed certificate. Only https is enabled on port 8443. You can access it at `https://gateway-ip:8443`.

## Accessing the Device using the VIRSH Console

You can also access the vSRX from the gateway server Operating System:

1. Log onto your gateway server by running the command `ssh root@<server-ip>`.
2. Run the command `virsh list` to find your vSRX VM name.
3. Run the command `virsh console <your vSRX VM name>`.

## Creating system users

By default, the IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX is configured with SSH access for the username `admin`. Additional users can be added with their own set of priorities. For example:

```
set system login user ops class operator authentication encrypted-password <CYPHER>
```

In this example, `ops` is the username and `operator` is the class/permission level assigned to the user.

Customized classes can be also defined as opposed to pre-defined ones.

## Defining the vSRX hostname

You can set or change the vSRX hostname using the following command:

```
set system host-name <hostname>
```

## Configuring DNS and NTP

To configure name server resolution and NTP, run the following commands:

```
set system name-server <DNS server>
set system ntp <NTP server>
```

## Changing the root password

You can change the root password by running the following command:

```
set system root-authentication plain-text-password
```

This prompts you to input a new password, which is encrypted and stored in the configuration, and is not visible.
