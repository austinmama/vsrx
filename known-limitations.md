# Known Limitations for IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX
{: #known-limitations-for-ibm-cloud-juniper-vsrx}

Current limitations for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} IBMÂ® Cloud Juniper vSRX:

* Juniper vSRX Gateway is deployed with networking virtualization using Linux Bridge. Linux Bridge based networking virtualization can only achieve limited throughput and never line-rate throughput.

* There is no support to upgrade from Standalone to High-availability mode.

* IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX Gateway is deployed with the options of Junos OS version `15.1` or `18.4`. Currently, there is no support for upgrading/downgrading to a different version.

* Remove the 60-day eval license as it may cause the kernel to generate ERROR messages even when there is another (valid) license on the system.
