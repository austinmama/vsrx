# Known limitations for IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX
{: #known-limitations-for-ibm-cloud-juniper-vsrx}

There are some limitations to be aware of when using {{site.data.keyword.vsrx_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

* IBM Cloud has temporarily suspended new sales of 1G Highly Available (HA) Juniper installations. This restriction is due to a pending design change that is required to improve HA stability. The offering is projected to become available again in Q2 2020.

* Due to incompatible networking elements, the Juniper vSRX solution is not available as follows:

      - Neither 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps versions in the SEA01 (Seattle, WA) data center
      - 10 Gbps version in WDC01 (Washington, DC)
      - 1G and 10G High Availability versions in: AMS01, DAL05, DAL06, DAL07, HKG02, HOU02, SJC01, SNG01, and WDC01

* Juniper vSRX gateway is deployed with networking virtualization by using Linux Bridge. Linux Bridge based networking virtualization can achieve only limited throughput and never line-rate throughput.

* There is no support to upgrade from Standalone to High-availability mode.

* {{site.data.keyword.vsrx_full}} Gateway is deployed with the options of Junos OS version `15.1` or `18.4`. Currently, upgrading/downgrading to a different version is not supported.

* The 60-day evaluation license might cause the kernel to generate error messages, even when another (valid) license is on the system. Remove any 60-day evaluation licenses to avoid this issue. To do so, follow these steps:

   1. Log in to your vSRX gateway device.
   
   2. Enter CLI mode by running the command `cli` at the console prompt.

   3. Run the command to get the license identifier:

      ```
      show system license
      ```

      Output is similar to the following:

      ```
      License usage:
                                     Licenses     Licenses    Licenses    Expiry

      Licenses installed:

      ```

   4. Copy the identifier of the license that you want to delete and run the command:
   
      ```
      request system license delete <license identifier>
      ```
