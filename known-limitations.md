# Known Limitations

Current limitations for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} IBMÂ® Cloud Juniper vSRX:

* Juniper vSRX Gateway is deployed with networking virtualization using Linux Bridge. Linux Bridge based networking virtualization can only achieve limited throughput and never line-rate throughput.

* There is no support to upgrade from Standalone to High-availability mode.

* IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX Gateway is deployed with Junos OS version `15.1X49-D123`. Currently, there is no support for upgrading to a different version.
