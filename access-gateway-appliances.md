The Gateway Appliances page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure is where you can display and access all network gateway appliances, including the {{site.data.keyword.vsrx_full}}.  
{: shortdesc}

Follow these steps to access the Gateway Appliances page.

1. From your browser, open [https://cloud.ibm.com ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com){:new_window} and log in to your account.
2. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the upper left, then click **Classic Infrastructure**.
3. Choose **Network > Gateway Appliances**.

The Gateway Appliances List page has additional features including sorting by Name, Vendor, or Location. Clicking the header for these columns sorts your gateways alphabetically for convenient viewing. If you'd prefer more gateways appear on the page, click the menu in the lower left and expand the grid to your liking. Furthermore, in the lower right area, you can switch pages to view the rest of your gateways.  

You can also rename your gateway. To do so, click the overflow menu in the rightmost part of the grid.
