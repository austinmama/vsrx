* Is the content technically accurate (no further review is required)?
* Did you spell-check your changes?
* Did you update the `lastupdated` date at the top of the page?
* If you linked to a Cloud Docs topic, did you use a relative link (`/docs/etc`)?
* If you changed an anchor or title identifier `{: #xxx}`, did you create a [URL redirect request](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/Bluemix-doc-framework/issues/new?assignees=Nick-Gong&labels=redirect-request&template=redirect_request.md&title=Redirect+Request)? 

**Tip**: When in doubt, see [IBM Cloud Doc Guidelines](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/developing/writing?topic=writing-get-started-onboarding#get-started-onboarding).
