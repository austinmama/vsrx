	Before reclaiming a gateway, make sure all protected VLANs have been [disassociated](manage-vlans.html) from it. 
	{:note} 

3. On the device's page, click **Cancel Device** in the Action drop down menu to access the Server Configuration page.  

4. On the Cancel Device confirmation screen, begin the reclaim process by clicking **Continue**. If you do not want to proceed with the reclaim, click **Close**.

For HA pairs, these actions will need to be performed on both devices.
