# Securing the Host Operating System
{: #securing-host-operating-system}

The {{site.data.keyword.vsrx_full}} runs on a bare-metal server installed with Ubuntu and KVM. To secure the host OS, you should ensure that no other critical services are hosted on the same OS.
{: shortdesc}

If a public IP is assigned to the host, you can remove it and use the private IP instead.
{: note}

Implementing an Ubuntu firewall (UFW, Iptables, and so on) without required rules can cause the {{site.data.keyword.vsrx}} HA cluster to be disabled. The vSRX solution depends on heartbeat communication between the primary and secondary nodes. If the firewall rules do not allow communication between the nodes, then cluster communication will be lost.
{: important}

The following rules are used to allow cluster communication for UFW:

- To allow protocol 47 (used for heartbeat communication) in /etc/ufw/before.rules:

  ```
  -A ufw-before-input -p 47 -j ACCEPT
  ```

- To allow private network communication:

```
ufw allow in from 10.0.0.0/8 to 10.0.0.0/8
```

- To enable UFW:

```
ufw enable
```

Most Gateway actions require SSH access to the host OS and the {{site.data.keyword.vsrx}} to execute. Blocking this access with a firewall can cause the following actions to fail:

- OS Reload
- Rebuild Cluster
- Upgrade Version

As a result, if SSH access is disabled, you must re-enable it prior to executing any of these actions.
